# cluster-analysis
ovito_cluster.py will output cluster data from OVITO software for all the timesteps present in a LAMMPS trajectory
Run ovito_cluster.py from within ovito if using GUI or use ovitos
cluster_count.m will compute the numbe of clusters over all the timesteps
avg_cluster_size.m will compute the average cluster size at each timestep
